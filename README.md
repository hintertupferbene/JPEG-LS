# Source
This implementation is based on the code from https://sourceforge.net/p/jpeg/svn/HEAD/tree/jpeg_ls/

Only minor modifications have been made (see history of this project).

# How to build
1. Create build directory:
```
mkdir build
```

2. Step into this directory and run cmake:
```
cd build
cmake ../
```

3. Build the project:
```
make
```


Finally, the directory 'build/bin' contains binaries and a lib.
